# Day - 2

## SDLC

- software development life cycle : it the process where idea transform to action (end-application)

## Step in SDLC

Requirement Gathering -> Design specification -> Implementation -> testing -> Deployment -> Maintainence

## Model

### Water Flow 
- Sequence flow follows the above step

### Iterative Model
- Small set of task to complete part of application

### Prototype Model
- An working prototype to customer until confirmed and start from implemetation

### Spiral  Model
- Iterative model + Water Fall

### V Model
- Testing and Developement side by side from requirement gathering to deployment.

## STLC

- As software become complex the testing phase is not enough for delivering a good software so we make the testing from stage one itself called software testing life cycle

## Phase of STLC

Requirement analysis ( what to test and what not to test ) -> Test Planning and control (make the plan for test case ,document and budget example nummber of test case ) -> Test Case Development ( Writing manual test case or automating script using tools like selenium ) -> Test Environment setup (place to run the test cases ) -> Test Execution ( execute test case and find bug and fix it) -> Test closure (test report and documents and clean up test environment)
