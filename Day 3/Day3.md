# Day - 3

## Level of testing

Start from unit and end at system testing

## unit testing
Developer test every function/ independent module using developer tool/software like jest,nunit etc.,

## Integration testing

Test the issue between interfacing different modules 

The type are 
- top-down : User interface to low level function
- bottom-up : Low level function to user interface
-  BigBang : every module is connected and test entirely

## System testing

Testing entire application as a whole in environment similar to production (dev/test)

## Acceptance testing

Running the entire application in a User Acceptance and validating with user requirement

if tester are internal testing team and employees : alpha

if tester are end-user then testing : beta

Non -functional testing involves stressing memory,network etc., to check out application works fine

Usablity test : checking user experience

Compatibility test : check a web application support different platform

On the higher level testing is divided into 3 boxes and it is based on knowledge of tester about internal working of the software.

- Black box : Tester have no knowledge of internal  working.Provide input and verify output

- Grey box : Tester have some knowledge like knowing about different user to test a web application.
